Benefits of Magnetic Line Tracking
Benefits of Magnetic Line Tracking
Because they are totally passive, magnetic tracks are easy to lay and modify. They are dirt immune and can be 
made totally invisible under carpet, tile or other flooring cover. The table below lists the differences between the 
three major line following technologies used in the industry today.
TABLE 1. 
Magnetic Optical Induction
| Track type                   |     | Passive   | Passive    | Active (1)    |
| ---------------------------- | --- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Track shape                  |     | Flat tape | Flat trace | Wire          |
| Track laying                 |     | Easy      | Easy       | Difficult (2) |
| Laying forks & merges        |     | Easy      | Easy       | Difficult (2) |
| Dirt immune                  |     | Yes       | No         | Yes           |
| Sensible to light conditions |     | No        | Yes        | No            |
| Invisible track              |     | Yes (3)   | No         | Yes           |
| Markers                      |     | Yes (4)   | No         | No            |
Note 1: Requires high frequency current to flow in wire.
Note 2: Forks & merges must not disrupt current flow.
Note 3: Magnetic tape may be hidden under carpet or other non ferrous floor covering.
Note 4: Markers use tape of inverted magnetic polarity and therefore very distinctive to the sensor.
Magnetic Tape Selection & Installation
The sensor is factory calibrated for use with 25mm or 50mm wide tape from Roboteq, but may be used with tape 
from other suppliers as well. Only unipolar tape must be used, where one side is all of one magnetic polarity and 
the other of the other polarity. In the default configuration, the sensor expect South on the top side for the track 
and North on the top side for markers. The sensor can be configured to operate with tape of inverted polarity. The 
sensor will not work with tape of alternating polarity.

FIGURE 1. Magnetic tape
Operating height is up to 50mm when used with 25mm wide tape and 60mm when used with 50mm wide tape. 
At higher heights, the magnetic field of the tape is weaker and the sensor will be less immune to noise. For best 
results, operate at 20 to 30mm with 25mm tape and 20 to 40mm with 50mm tape.
Sensor Installation
The sensor must be mounted so that it is parallel with the floor and the magnetic track. Two mounting holes are 
provided at both ends of the enclosure. When installing, allow room the accessing the USB connector under the 
plug.

I/O and Power Cable
The MGS1600 comes with a 15-pin DSub connector a the end of 2.0 meter multiconductor cables for powering 
the sensor and accessing all the I/O signals. The connector can be cut off and the connections done directly on 
the wires. The connector pins and wire colors are identified in the table below.

Powering the sensor
Apply a 4.5V to 30V Max voltage between the ground wire (black) or braid, and the power input wire (red). Beware 
not to confuse the solid red power wire with the red/black wire. If needed, the sensor can be powered down by 
connecting the Power Down wire (yellow & black) to ground, or applying a logic 0 signal. If the Power Down wire

Serial Port Settings
is floating, or pulled above 1.5V, the sensor will turn on. The sensor will also be powered if it is connected to a PC
via the USB connector. The Power Down wire will not turn off the sensor if powered from the USB.
RS232 Connection
Serial communication with the sensor is done using the RxData (grey) and RxData (white) signals. The ground
wire (black or braid) must be connected in order to provide a reference to the RxData and TxData signal. Serial
communication will not work with microcomputers equipped with TTL-levels serial ports.
PWM Output
The PWM Output wire (blue) is always active and will give the tape position by varying the duty cycle from 50%,
when the tape is centered, to 25% and 75% duty cycle when the tape is at one end or the other of the sensor.
The PWM output is centered at 50% when no tape is detected.
Analog Output
The Analog Output wire (yellow) is always active and will give the tape position by varying the voltage from 1.50V,
when the tape is centered, to 1.20 and 1.80V when the tape is at one end or the other of the sensor. The Analog
output is centered at 1.50V when no tape is detected.
Track Present Outputs
The Track Present wire will output a 5V level when a magnetic tape is within the sensor's range. If no tape is
detected, the output will be set to 0V.
Left and Right Markers Outputs
The Left Marker wire (brown) and Right Marker wire (orange) will output a 5V level when a left or right marker is
detected by the sensor. If no marker is detected, the output will be set to 0V. These output mirror the state of the
left and right marker detect LEDs.
Fork Left and Fork Right Inputs
The Fork Left wire (pink) and Fork Right wire (purple) are used to select which of the Left or Right tape capture
must be output on the PWM and Analog wires.
CAN Low and CAN High
The CAN Low wire (light green and black) and CAN High wire (red and black) are used to connect the sensor to a
CAN network. Do not confuse the solid red wire (Power supply) with the red/black wire (CAN High). The sensor
does not include a 120 ohm termination resistor.
Serial Port Settings
The baud rate and communication settings on the sensor are set as follows:
• 115200 bits/s
• 8-bit data
• Even parity
• No flow control
The baud rate can be changed to different values but only while the controller is connected to the configuration
PC utility via USB. Beware that once the baud rate is changed, it will no longer be possible to have the PC utility
communicate with the sensor via the serial port until the speed is changed back to 115200 bit/s.

Track information
The presence and position of a magnetic track is output on the I/O connector, and/or transmitted via the serial
communication port or USB. When the sensor detects the presence of a magnetic track it will activate the Track
Present output on the I/O connector. The track position information is also output as a 0-3V analog signal, and a
PWM pulse of user definable period and duty cycle range. The track detect and position are reported on the
RS232 or USB ports. The position is reported as a signed value, in millimeters, using the center of the sensor as
the 0 reference.
Fork and Merge Management
The sensor has an algorithm for detecting and managing up to 2-way forks and merges along the track. Internally,
the controller always assumes that 2 tracks are present: a left track and a right track. When following a single
track, the sensor considers that the 2 tracks are superimposed. When entering forks, the track widens, so does
the distance between the left and right tracks.

L=-0, R=50
L=-0, R=20

FIGURE 4. Fork management
When approaching merges, the sensor will report a sudden spread of the left and right tracks, but will otherwise
operate the same way as at forks.

Marker Detection
Both tracks positions can be read via the serial port. Using the state of the Fork Left and Fork Right digital inputs, 
the sensor will select the left or right track information onto the analog and PWM outputs, according to the selec-
tion table below.
TABLE 3. 
| Fork Left |     | Fork Right | Analog and PWM Output                      |     |
| --------- | --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Low       |     | Low        | No change                                  |     |
| High      |     | Low        | Left track position                        |     |
| Low       |     | High       | Right track position                       |     |
| High      |     | High       | Left or right track position depending on  |     |
command received on RS232/USB
When both inputs are high or unconnected, the selected track will be based on command received via the sen-
sor's serial/USB port, or set using the sensor's scripting language.
Marker Detection
Markers are pieces of magnetic tape that are affixed on the left or/and right side of the main track. To differentiate 
them from the track, markers have opposite magnetic polarity. These markers can be used to inform the robot of 
special areas along the track, such as forks or merges ahead, high or low speed zones, charge stations, etc. Mark-
ers must be positioned 15 to 30mm away from the edge of the main track for proper operation.

FIGURE 6. Direction markers
The figure below shows example of a simple marker (i.e. marker present or absent) and 2 dimensional markers 
where a pattern is used to encode more complex information. In this example, using the built in scripting lan-
guage, the sensor can be made to count the number of right markers while a left marker is present.

Gyroscope (optional)
The sensor may be ordered with a built-in 3-axis MEMs Gyroscope (MGS1600GY version). The Gyroscope pro-
vides an accurate measurement of the rate of rotation along each of the sensors planes with 3 levels of resolu-
tion: +/-250 degrees/s, +/-500 degrees/s and +/-2000 degrees/s. The Gyroscope can be used to provide added
stability to the AGV. It can also be used to make the AGV continue to move in a straight line, without guiding tape,
between two magnetic tapes or magnetic pins.
The Gyroscope values can be read via USB, Serial or CANbus. The Z sensor value is also automatically transmitted
to a Roboteq motor controller, along with the magnetic sensor data, using a single wire and the MultiPWM mode.
The Gyroscope values are integers with the following range:
TABLE 4.

+Y -Y
FIGURE 8. Orientation of the Gyroscope axis
Diagnostic LEDs
Since magnetic fields are invisible, the sensor is equipped with four LEDs to help setup and troubleshooting. The
LED positions are shown in Figure2. The Power LED will lit when the sensor is on. The Track Detect/Track Posi-
tion LED is a dual usage LED that will lit when a track is present. The LED is bicolor and will gradually shift to red
when the track is at the left of the sensor, and to green as the track moves to the right. Two additional LEDs will
turn on when left or right markers are detected.

Interfacing the Sensor to Roboteq Motor Controllers
The MGS1600 will interface directly and seamlessly to all Roboteq models of controllers for brushed and brush-
less DC motors. The sensor can be powered from the controller's 5V output. The left, right, tape detect and
marker information is sent from the sensor using the PWM Output configured as "Roboteq MultiPWM". The sig-
nal must be connected to any of the controller's Pulse Inputs configured with the PC utility as "Magsensor". The
data is sent continuously with a 10ms update rate. Roboteq provides script examples that run in the motor con-
troller for implementing basic line following AGV functionality.

Using the PC Utility
A powerful utility is available for download from Roboteq's web site for setting up, monitoring and performing
maintenance functions. While the sensor is delivered ready to use right off the box, it contains many parameters
that can easily be changed using user-friendly menus. For testing and troubleshooting, the utility includes a graph
that plots in real time the shape and strength of the magnetic field as it is seen by the sensor. A strip chart recorder
allows the user to plot the track and marker information, and save the data in an excel spreadsheet for analysis. The
utility is also used for performing field updates of the sensor firmware and for editing and running scripts.

MicroBasic Scripting
The MGS1600 features the ability for the user to write programs that are permanently saved into, and run from the
sensor's Flash Memory. This capability is the equivalent of combining the functionality of a PLC or Single Board Com-
puter directly into the sensor. The language is a very simple, yet powerful language that resembles Basic. Scripts can
be simple or elaborate, and can be used for various purposes. For example sensor data manipulation and conversion,
2 dimension marker processing, or even the full motion and steering control for a simple line following robot.
Sensor Calibration
The sensor is factory calibrated for 25mm and 50mm wide magnetic tapes available from Roboteq. If tapes of dif-
ferent width or magnetic strength are used, the sensor can be recalibrated by the user. The sensor is also factory
calibrated to compensate for the natural ambient magnetic field. For best results, the ambient "zero" must be
reset in every new installation. This is done by clicking on the "Calibrate Zero" button on the Setup tab of the PC
utility. Make sure that the sensor is away from any magnetic material when doing the zero calibration.

Command Reference Summary
Command Reference Summary
The sensor accepts a number of commands via its RS232 and USB ports for reading operational data, sending 
commands, setting configuration, and performing maintenance.
Real Time Queries
These are commands for reading sensor data. They begin with the question mark character. Table5 shows the list 
of supported queries.
Each time a query is executed, it is stored in a history buffer and may therefore be automatically repeated at a 
periodic rate using the # character with the following syntax:
#   repeat last query in queue
# nn   repeat last queries ever nn ms. Example: # 100 to execute one query from the history queue every 100ms
# C   clear queue

Configuration Commands
These commands are used to read or modify sensor configuration parameters. They begin with the ~ character 
for reading and the ^ character for writing. Table7 shows the list of supported configuration commands. How-
ever, it is easier and preferable to use the PC utility menus for inspecting and changing configurations. If changing 
manually, remember to save the new configuration to flash with the %EESAV. Otherwise, the sensor will revert 
to the previously active configuration next time it is powered on.
